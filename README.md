# Inter-train Ticketing System

 
A web-based inter-city train ticketing system - which aims to address the issues of standing in queues for prolonged periods to purchase tickets, cash payment hassles, and provide general ease of access. Users can log-on to the website via the URL to book their tickets by providing the requisite information; destination/origin preferences, date & time, seat selection, number of passengers, contact information, payment options, confirmation of ticket etc. The website can cater multiple users and hosts a selection of city destinations to choose from. Users can opt for a single-route journey, subsequently download the e-ticket, or print it for use. The web application also provides an administrator login, allowing for the viewing of ticket sales reports, transaction history, and in general a reporting mechanism for the administration.
